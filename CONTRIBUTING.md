# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to Kubernetes. We are excited about the prospect of you joining our [community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community)! The Kubernetes community abides by the CNCF [code of conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

## Getting Started

We have full documentation on how to get started contributing here:

### Semantic Commit Messages

We use [semantic commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in this repository.

They follow this format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

Examples for commit messages following this are:

`feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs`

You can also include a scope within parenthesis:

`fix(scope): Prevent wrong calculation of storage`

Here's a list of types that we use:

| Type | Explanation |
|---|---|
| feat | A new feature |
| fix | A bug fix |
| docs | Documentation only changes |
| style | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| perf |  A code change that improves performance |
| test | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| build |Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm) |
| ci | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) |
| chore | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| revert | Reverts a previous commit |
